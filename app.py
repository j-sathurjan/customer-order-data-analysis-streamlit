Streamlit Application: Customer Order Data Engineering Dashboard

This application is built with Streamlit and provides an interactive dashboard
for data analysis and machine learning on customer order data.
The app includes three main pages:
1. Dashboard: Provides data visualizations, filters, and key metrics.
2. Original Data: Allows users to upload CSV files to a MySQL database and give insights about data.
3. Machine Learning: Displays machine learning predictions and insights.

Each page is implemented as a function, keeping the code modular and organized.

Modules:
- data(): Displays the contents of "Original Data" page by calling data_upload_page_display.
- home(): Displays the Dashboard page, calling functions for filtering, visualizations, and metrics.
- ml(): Displays the Machine Learning page with ML model predictions or processing insights.
